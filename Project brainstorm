Rise of the Planet Mars (Brainstorm Ideas)
The project idea for the game that we are going to make is based on survival/RPG a first person shooter view. The story that we considered is that a bunch of aliens and Monsters trying to get the earth’s resource of water as they have exhausted their waters in planet Mars, they will have abilities like running or shooting at us has invaded the earth, and the earth has lost, thus there is one survivor in which he will save the world from the alien invasion. The map of this story would be outdoor in ruins and in an open space, considering there will be battlefield present. 
	Each level in this game will have varieties of aliens/monsters and then finally at level 3 there will be a boss fight in which the man protagonist will have to defeat him in order to save the world. Some enemies will drop down items that can be used to upgrade the character as well as weapons to proceed onto the next level. 
	The control of the character should be basic running walking jumping as well as shooting, melee, reloading, and throwing a grenade same goes with the alien characters with an added extra “bursting”. As for the boss its yet to be determined.
